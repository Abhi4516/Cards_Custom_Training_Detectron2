# Cards Custom Training with Detectron2

This project implements a custom training pipeline using Detectron2 for object detection in card images. The primary objective is to accurately identify and localize various card types using deep learning techniques.

### What is Detectron2?

Detectron2 is a state-of-the-art object detection framework developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). It is built on PyTorch and offers a robust platform for implementing object detection algorithms, including Mask R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet. Detectron2 is designed for both research and production applications, providing flexibility and high performance.

### Custom Training

Custom training in Detectron2  allows users to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks by training them on unique datasets. This involves:

1. **Data Preparation** : Organizing datasets into the required format (e.g., COCO format).
2. **Configuring Training Parameters** : Adjusting model hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and augmentation techniques.
3. **Model Training** : Fine-tuning the model on the custom dataset to achieve high accuracy.
4. **Evaluation** : Assessing the model's performance using various metrics to ensure it meets the required standards.

### Dataset

* The dataset contains images of various types of cards annotated with bounding boxes. Ensure that your dataset is organized correctly for Detectron2 to recognize the annotations.

### Results

* The results section will include visualizations of the model's predictions and evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP scores.
